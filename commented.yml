> [AWS RDS Postgres] is AWS's implementation of the popular postgres database.

Releases as well as deprecation dates do not match perfectly with source postgres releases (typically releasing about a month behind). 

For this reason a seperate service end of life API can be useful to provide accurate deprecation dates.
